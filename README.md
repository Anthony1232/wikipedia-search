# wikipedia-search
a program that uses web scraping to look up any wiki site the user requests


A personal challenge for me to create an adaptive program for searching Wikipedia

acts like a search engine exclusively for wikipedia

returns information from a website and can save said information on hosts computer

looks for similar sites if none the user inputted are found and automatically picks the best option
